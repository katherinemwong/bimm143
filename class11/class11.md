``` r
method.sums <- colSums(db)
round((method.sums/method.sums["Total"] * 100), 2)
```

EM: 4.92% X-ray 87.55%

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

``` r

```

    ## [1] 87.36  5.14  5.31  2.08  0.10  0.01

proteins: 87.36%

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and

1828 Structures

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom
> per water molecule in this structure?

Hydrogen atoms are way too small in comparison to oxygen, so we can only
see oxygen!

> Q5: There is a conserved water molecule in the binding site. Can you
> identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water
> molecule have (see note below)?

Residue 308.

# Sequence Viewer Extension (Optional)

> Q6: As you have hopefully observed HIV protease is a homodimer
> (i.e.Â it is composed of two identical chains). With the aid of the
> graphic display and the sequence viewer extension can you identify
> secondary structure elements that are likely to only form in the dimer
> rather than the monomer?

Not sure:)
